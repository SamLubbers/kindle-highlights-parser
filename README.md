# Kindle highlights parser

Simple script to transform kindle csv export to txt file.

Currently (14/3/18) kindle exports your notes in a csv file, with each row containing a certain highlight or note at a given location in the book. This is not the most appropriate output format if you want to store or review your notes. This script aims to convert the data in the csv to a text format, in which notes are separated by chapter.
